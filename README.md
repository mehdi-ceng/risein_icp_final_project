# improved todo

Welcome to your my improved todo project.
New functionalities:
1. deleteTodo():  Now we can delete todo item(for instance, if we made mistake when we create it or we changed our plan and so on).
2. markIncomplete(): If we mark some todo item as complete, using this function we can undo the effect.
3. editTodoDescription(): We can change the description of todo item.
